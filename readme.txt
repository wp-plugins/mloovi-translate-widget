== Description ==

The Mloovi widget allows you to easily add links to 57 different language versions of your blog and RSS feeds.

The widget allow you to choose which languages show in your sidebar and adds a 'more' link to show all 57 languages. The widget can be styled using your standard CSS file so it will fit in with the look and feel of your site.

The translated files are generated by mloovi.com and are displayed in your sidebar.

Unlike most translation widgets Mloovi creates a permanent URL for your translated blogs which allows search engines to index your site in different languages.

This can have incredible results for SEO, we currently have sites indexed by over 50 different language versions of Google as well as Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, Yandex & Seznam. Your content become available to the whole world no matter what language they speak!
